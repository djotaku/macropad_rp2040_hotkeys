# Macropad RP2040 - Hotkeys Project

As of 20210801 the code in Code.py is exactly what was available from Adafruit's tutorial for CircuitPython 7.x on this day. It works well so, for now, rather than reinvent the wheel, I'm just adding my own Macros. (In addition to using some of the macros they already had in there)

## Current Custom Macros

- OBS - this contains a macropad setup for the OBS I use most often. Before this I was using a hacked-together Macropad/Streamdeck using a [QTPy](https://github.com/djotaku/qtpy_streamdeck) with only 2 buttons so I hadn't thought about what I might do with 12 buttons. As of 20210801, it only makes use of the top 9 keys. It also does not do anything with the Encoder button press.
